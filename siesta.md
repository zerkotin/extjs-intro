# Siesta Tests for ExtJS
Siesta is a framework that helps in creating UI tests for ExtJS apps.  
It is quite simple and easy to use.  

## The Harness
To use Siesta on your app, you have to bind them somehow, in the _Siesta_ language it is called Harnessing.  
Take a look at the [Harness](https://www.bryntum.com/docs/siesta/#!/api/Siesta.Harness) page.

## Actions
To test things we need a way to interract with the UI, we interract using _Actions_.  
Take a look at the [Actions](https://www.bryntum.com/docs/siesta/#!/api/Siesta.Test.Action) page.  
This page introduces all the various actions we can use.

The most common actions in our arsenal
- [Click](https://www.bryntum.com/docs/siesta/#!/api/Siesta.Test.Action.Click)
- [Type](https://www.bryntum.com/docs/siesta/#!/api/Siesta.Test.Action.Type)
- [Wait](https://www.bryntum.com/docs/siesta/#!/api/Siesta.Test.Action.Wait)

## Chain
The chain is how we write consecutive orders, it is conrolling and defining the flow of actions/functions.  
Take a look at the [Chain](https://www.bryntum.com/docs/siesta/#!/api/Siesta.Test-method-chain) page.
